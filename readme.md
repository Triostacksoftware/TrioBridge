## 🧭 Purpose of the Project

Traditional intern management often lacks structure — scattered training files, delayed documents, unclear task tracking, and no feedback loop. TrioBridge fixes this by combining:

✅ Centralized video training  
✅ Auto-generated joining/offer/certificate documents  
✅ Kanban-style task management  
✅ Direct mentor reviews & intern feedback  
✅ Anonymous suggestion & complaint box  
✅ Role-based dashboards for Interns, Mentors, and Admins
